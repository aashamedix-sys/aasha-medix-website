# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#2E7D32"

  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should exist in the assets/images directory.
  # image: assets/images/logo.png

  # The color_dark parameter can be used to specify the background color of the splash screen
  # in dark mode. If they are not specified, the color will be used instead.
  color_dark: "#1B5E20"

  # The image_dark parameter can be used to specify the image used on the splash screen
  # in dark mode. It must be a png file.
  # image_dark: assets/images/logo_dark.png

  # It must be a png file. It is supported for Android, iOS and the Web.  For Android 12+
  # the file is shown over the Android 12+ splash screen.
  #branding: assets/dart.png

  # To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom, bottomRight,
  # and bottomLeft. The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else.
  #branding_mode: bottom

  # The color_dark_transparent parameter can be used to specify the background color of the
  # splash screen in dark mode with transparency. It must be a hex color with 8 characters.
  #color_dark_transparent: "#1B5E20D2"

  # The background_image parameter allows you to specify an image used as a background image
  # for the splash screen. The image will be stretch to the size of the app.

  # The background_image_dark parameter allows you to specify an image used as a background
  # image for the splash screen in dark mode.
  #background_image_dark: "assets/images/background_dark.png"

  # prefer to use the legacy splash screen on Android 12+, set the following parameter to true.
  #android_12_plus: true

  # The android, ios and web parameters can be used to disable generating a splash screen on a given
  # platform.
  #android: false
  #ios: false
  #web: false

  # Platform specific images can be specified with the following parameters, which will replace
  # the image parameter.  If image parameter exists along with the platform specific parameter,
  # the platform specific parameter will be used instead.

  # is positioned in the splash screen.
  # android_gravity can be one of: center, top, bottom, left, right, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, center-horizontal, center-vertical
  # ios_content_mode can be one of: scaleToFill, scaleAspectFit, scaleAspectFill, center, top, bottom, left, right, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight
