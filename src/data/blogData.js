      <p>In recent years, India has seen a sharp increase in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. The old adage "Prevention is better than cure" has never been more relevant.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">The Silent Epidemic</h3>
      <p>Many conditions do not show symptoms until they are advanced. A simple blood test can reveal high sugar or cholesterol levels, allowing you to make dietary changes before medication becomes necessary.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Economic Benefits</h3>
      <p>Treating a chronic illness is far more expensive than preventing it. Regular checkups are a small investment that protects your family from heavy financial burdens later.</p>
      <p>At AASHA MEDIX, we offer tailored health packages for families in Telangana to keep you safe and healthy.</p>
